# Write Text into Menubar (BitBar + Alfred)

It is my very first plugins for BitBar and Alfred Workflows! You need to follow this way to install:

### Installation

 * Make sure that you have a BitBar extension.
 * You BitBar plugin folder have to be installed ~/Documents/Bitbar-Plugins/
 * Drag and drop your BitBar plugin into ~/Documents/Bitbar-Plugins/write-into-menubar-bitbar-plugin.1s.sh
 * You need to run this Terminal Command to add chmod into your Bitbar Plugin
 
```bash
chmod +x ~/Documents/Bitbar-Plugins/write-into-menubar-bitbar-plugin.1s.sh
```
 
 ### Customization
 
 You can also config this plugin according to you needs - just change variables in BitBar plugin:
 
 * You can change text color by changing: quote_color="black"
 * You can set length of string by changing: max_chars="30" 


 ### Dependencies

You need to have BitBar (completely free) and Alfred Powerpack (paid one) to use this plugin.

Take a look to download then:

 * [Alfred 3](https://www.alfredapp.com/) to run .AlfredWorkflow
 * [BitBar](https://getbitbar.com/) to show final result of .sh plugin
